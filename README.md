### Purpose <a name="purp"></a>

The objective of this project is to evaluate existing optical or
spectral models developed for the tidal Caloosahatchee River Estuary and
surrounding areas. Optical models are useful in Colored dissolved
organic matter (CDOM) dominated estuaries to evaluate changes in light
attenuation and potential impacts to benthic ecology.

### Study Area <a name="area"></a>

The Caloosahatchee River and its estuary is located on the lower west
coast of Florida, USA (Fig 1). The historic Caloosahatchee River was
originally shallow, meandering river with its headwaters located
approximately 100 km inland at Lake Hicpochee and tidally influences
approximately 70 km upstream. To accommodate navigation, flood control
and land reclamation needs the river was straightened and extended
eastward and connected to Lake Okeechobee in the late 1800s essentially
converting the river to a canal, resulting in the C-43 canal
designation. In the early 1900s three lock-and-dam structures were
constructed to control flow and stage elevation along the river. Of the
three lock-and-dam structures installed, the final downstream structure
identified as the S-79 (Franklin Lock and Dam) regulates discharge from
the canal to the estuary. The estuary portion of the Caloosahatchee
River (hereafter Caloosahatchee River Estuary or CRE) extends
approximately 48 km from the S-79 to San Carlos Bay, where it empties
into the Gulf of Mexico and Pine Island Sound

### Data <a name="data"></a>

Data from South Florida Water Management District SFWMD and Lee County
were collated into a final dataset. The final dataset will have optical,
physical and nutrient parameters for monitoring locations within the
Caloosahatchee River Estuary.

-   *SFWMD:*
    -   Fatally Qualified data were removed.
    -   Only samples taken within the first 2 meters were considered.
    -   If more than one sample was collected in a given day, average
        values were computed (including samples within the 2-meter water
        depth).
-   *Lee County:*
    -   Surface water samples only
    -   Fatally qualified data were removed.
    -   Field duplicate samples (QA/QC) were removed.

### Literature <a name="lit"></a>

Some literature with general summaries specific to this project.

    Colored Dissolved Organic Matter and Its Potential Ecological
    Implication in the Caloosahatchee River Estuary, Florida. Estuaries

    -   CDOM is one of the most important water quality constituents
        impacting light attenuation in estuaries; its concentration and
        distribution influence light quality and quantity available to
        phytoplankton and submerged aquatic vegetation.

    -   Light attenuation in the CRE was controlled primarily by CDOM in
        the upper estuary and by turbidity in the lower estuary. The
        contribution of chlorophyll a (Chl a) to light attenuation was
        less than both CDOM and turbidity.

    -   Provides an optical model to set water quality targets for
        color, turbidity and chlorophyll a that maintain
        percent-light-at-depth requirements to achieve the maximum
        seagrass depth distribution presently observed in seagrass
        transect monitoring. Analysis of recently collected water
        quality data show that in all regions of the harbor, dry season
        water quality in general met the percent-light-at-depth goals
        proposed in this effort but less than half the data met the
        goals during the wet season

    -   Quantify how primary light attenuation parameters affect the
        amount and quality of light reaching seagrass target depths
        through the development of a spectrally explicit optical model,
        based on partitioned absorption and scattering, and
        parameterized as a function of color, chlorophyll, and
        turbidity.

    -   light requirements were determined for four common and abundant
        seagrasses along the Gulf coast of peninsular Florida using a
        threshold detecting algorithm. Light requirements ranged from 8%
        to 10% of surface irradiance for *Halophila engelmannii* to
        25–27% of surface irradiance for *Halodule wrightii*.

    -   Study performed across a color (DOM) gardient from high
        (Steinhatchee, Suwannee and Waccasassa) to relatively clear
        water systems along the Springs Coast (Big Bend from Weeki
        Wachee to Steinhatchee).
