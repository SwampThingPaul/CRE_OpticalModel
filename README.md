Caloosahatchee River Estuary - Optical Model Evaluation
================

### Purpose

The objective of this project is to evaluate existing optical or
spectral models developed for the tidal Caloosahatchee River Estuary and
surrounding areas. Optical models are useful in Colored dissolved
organic matter (CDOM) dominated estuaries to evaluate changes in light
attenuation and potential impacts to benthic ecology.

    -   CDOM is one of the most important water quality constituents
        impacting light attenuation in estuaries; its concentration and
        distribution influence light quality and quantity available to
        phytoplankton and submerged aquatic vegetation.

    -   Light attenuation in the CRE was controlled primarily by CDOM in
        the upper estuary and by turbidity in the lower estuary. The
        contribution of chlorophyll a (Chl a) to light attenuation was
        less than both CDOM and turbidity.

    -   Provides an optical model to set water quality targets for
        color, turbidity and chlorophyll a that maintain
        percent-light-at-depth requirements to achieve the maximum
        seagrass depth distribution presently observed in seagrass
        transect monitoring. Analysis of recently collected water
        quality data show that in all regions of the harbor, dry season
        water quality in general met the percent-light-at-depth goals
        proposed in this effort but less than half the data met the
        goals during the wet season

    -   Quantify how primary light attenuation parameters affect the
        amount and quality of light reaching seagrass target depths
        through the development of a spectrally explicit optical model,
        based on partitioned absorption and scattering, and
        parameterized as a function of color, chlorophyll, and
        turbidity.
